# BetterLaddersFixed

This is a reupload of BetterLadders 1.2.2 to fix the errors that the latest versions have regarding SyncedInstance errors for the host or Failed to find Client ID Spam on clients

The networking in the later versions of the mod broke at some point and the original dev has been MIA for over a year, so this aims to resolve the current issues while a rewrite of the mod is being worked on.

## Currently Missing Features

Config Syncing with the host, for now make sure everyone has the same config settings or things will break and desync

Extension Ladder Configs from v1.4.3

## Future Plans

pacoito is helping me do a full rewrite for the mod to restore the missing features of v1.4.3 which will be released as v2.0.0, this should future proof the mod once the update is released and should ensure stability across game updates ^^

Fixing the errors when a client joins the lobby: With v1.2.2 these errors are harmless but with v1.2.3 and above these caused massive desyncs that caused Cosmocos to not load in Multiplayer for example

ReservedSlot Compat: I'm not even sure if the errors that were fixed with v1.2.3 still happen due to RIS being rewritten since then but the patch will be reimplemented regardless, for now don't hold a Flashlight from a Reserved Slot when climbing ladders to avoid potential NRE's
